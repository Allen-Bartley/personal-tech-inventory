# 🧰 Allen's Personal Tech Inventory & Lab Documentation

Welcome to my personal lab documentation hub. This repository catalogs the tools, peripherals, workflows, and real-world problem-solving strategies that power my study space, homelab, and entrepreneurial experiments. It reflects my philosophy of adaptability, hands-on learning, and strategic thinking.

Whether I’m configuring a server, digitizing media, or improvising a projector setup in a hotel room, this repo captures the gear and mindset that make it possible.
