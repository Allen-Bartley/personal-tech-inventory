# ðŸ§° Allen's Personal Tech Inventory & Lab Documentation

This repository documents the tools, peripherals, and creative problem-solving strategies that power my personal lab and study space. It includes everything from my everyday carry multitools to my digitized movie collection, and reflects my philosophy of resourcefulness, adaptability, and lifelong learning.

Whether I'm configuring a server, digitizing media, or improvising a projector setup in a hotel room, this repo captures the gear and mindset that make it possible.
