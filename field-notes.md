- Created a private network using a **mobile hotspot**
- Used a second phone to configure the Chromecast on the hotspot
- Played movies directly from my **SSK 1TB USB SSD stick** via phone

**Outcome:**  
Successfully created a portable, offline-friendly media setup. Demonstrated adaptability and cross-device troubleshooting in a constrained environment‚Äîideal for travel, client demos, or temporary workspaces.
